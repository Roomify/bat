BAT stands for Booking and Availability Management Tools.

It is a set of tools created by the [Roomify.us](https://roomify.us) team to provide a foundation through which a wide range of availability management, reservation and booking use cases can be addressed.
BAT will work with a variety of CMSs, of which the first is Drupal (check out our [Drupal module](https://github.com/roomify/bat_drupal)).

BAT builds on our experience with [Rooms](http://drupal.org/project/rooms), which handles the problem of bookings specifically for the accommodation for rental use case(vacation rentals, hotels, B&B, etc).

BAT on its own is a **booking and availability management framework** - much in the same way Drupal is a content management framework and Drupal Commerce is an e-commerce framework. Our aim is to build specific solutions on top of BAT to tackle specific application domains.
